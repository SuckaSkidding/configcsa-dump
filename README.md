their link to this poor shit software pasted (baguette link): https://configcsa.com

Hey , today i looked at a software called ConfigCsa ( a french software for many games), this software is just emulating a controler to give you aim assist on fps games.
its in csharp and i already bypassed the auth 
PLEASE IF YOU HAVE NO SKILL TO CRACK DONT TRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHECKS
first , you need to install all the files i sent , there is a Drivers.exe ( its just interception installer from github.com/oblitum/Interception } so you can install it in admin by doing in cmd in admin : Drivers.exe /install

here as you can see , they install something to emulate the controller to get the aimassist. so you would need to install it

to launch their launcher you need to launch ConfigCSA.exe in cmd with this args : ConfigCSA.exe Run

here as you see , when you launch ConfigCsa.exe , they will make a request with your hwid and password , and it will return "All Good" if its ok , so you can use HTTP debugger AutoReply function to do it as i did to bypass the auth 

after all of this , you would be in the main pannel of their launcher , but if you apply your config , they will just block your mouse and open random link to say " cracking is bad "

I'm so bad with c# so i let you guys crack it 

Please lmk if you cracked it : Sucka#2992
